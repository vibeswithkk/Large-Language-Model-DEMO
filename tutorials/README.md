## Prerequisites

Before running these tutorials, ensure you have:
- Python 3.8 or higher
- PyTorch 2.1.0 or higher
- CUDA-compatible GPU (recommended)
- All dependencies listed in the project's `requirements.txt`

## Usage

Each tutorial is designed as a standalone Jupyter notebook that can be executed independently. However, they build upon each other conceptually, so we recommend following them in numerical order for the best learning experience.

To run the tutorials:
```bash
# Start Jupyter notebook server
jupyter notebook

# Or use JupyterLab
jupyter lab
```

## Learning Path

1. **Beginner Track**: Start with tutorials 1-3 to understand the fundamentals of tensors, transformer architecture, and training.
2. **Intermediate Track**: Continue with tutorials 4-5 to master inference techniques and advanced model features.
3. **Advanced Track**: Complete tutorials 6-7 to learn production deployment strategies and practical implementation techniques.

## Key Features Demonstrated

- **CUDA Optimizations**: All models include CUDA and cuDNN optimizations for GPU acceleration
