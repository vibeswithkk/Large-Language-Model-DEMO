# Portfolio: Key Design Choices and Architectural Decisions

## Overview
This document outlines the critical design choices and architectural decisions made throughout the development of our transformer-based language model system. These decisions reflect a balance between cutting-edge research, practical implementation considerations, and production deployment requirements.

## 1. Model Architecture Decisions

### 1.1 Transformer Variant Selection

#### Choice: Hybrid Advanced Transformer Architecture
**Rationale**: 
- Combines the proven effectiveness of standard transformers with next-generation features

### 1.2 Attention Mechanism Design

#### Choice: Multi-Modal Adaptive Attention
```python
class MultiModalAdaptiveAttention(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, config):
        super().__init__()
        self.config = config
        self.num_modalities = config.num_modalities
        
        # Modality-specific projections
        self.q_proj = nn.ModuleList([
            nn.Linear(config.hidden_size, config.hidden_size)
            for _ in range(self.num_modalities)
        ])
        
        # Cross-modal weighting
        self.cross_modal_weights = nn.Parameter(
            torch.randn(self.num_modalities, self.num_modalities)
        )
```

**Benefits**:

        # Dynamic temperature based on context uncertainty
        temperature = self.compute_context_uncertainty(input_ids)
        
        # Adaptive top-k and top-p values
        top_k, top_p = self.compute_adaptive_sampling_params(input_ids)
        
        next_token = self.sample_next_token(
            logits, temperature, top_k, top_p
        )
```

**Advantages**:
- Context-aware generation parameters
